# pytorch-vggnet16

Project Overview
This project aims to implement VGGNet, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, using the PyTorch framework from scratch. The objective is to efficiently use the PyTorch framework and create a model without using any pre-trained models.

Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

vggnet.py
README.md - A detailed description of the project, how to run the code, dependencies, and reference materials.

Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Python 3.6 or later
PyTorch 1.8.0 or later
Torchvision 0.9.0 or later
NumPy 1.19.5 or later

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is taken from kaggle. its a dataset with 8 classes each representing an individual avenger. it contains a training and testing set of data. However due to the huge time it took me to train the model I had to cut the dataset to contain only 2 classes. the details of the number of images for each set can be found in the code.
